In this talk, Nithya A. Ruff who is the Sr. Director of Open Source Practice at Comcast, talked a lot about the trends in Open Source and how Comcast uses and contributes back to open source projects.

She started out by pointing out that 78% of tech companies run on open source software. She then went on to explain that because of Open Source, many companies have a different buisness model. It's shifting a lot from monitizing the software itself to the actual service, much like how Google makes money from ads and not selling it's software.

A big thing that I learned from this talk is that Comcast uses a lot of Open Source software and that it even contributes back to projects. Specifically Comcast has contributed to Apache and OpenStack. 

Overall, this talk was super informative and i'm glad that I attended.
