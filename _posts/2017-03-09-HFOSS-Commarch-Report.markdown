### Describe software project, its purpose and goals.
Docker is a project that automates the running and deployment of applications inside containers.
### Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
The initial commit was January 18th, 2013. As of Wednesday, March 8th, the last commit was around noon.
### Who approves patches? How many people?
The curators, of which 12 exist; however, the core maintainers can also do the same thing, of which 26 exist.
### Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
The core maintainers, a compiled list can be found here. 26 people can accept patches and merge them.
### Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your "Git-by-a-bus" report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with links if possible)
Jessica Frazelle
### What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"
0
### Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
There has been only slight modifications, very few people have left, but the first commit was only in 2013, so it has not existed for a very long time. It is also maintained by a company, Docker, Inc, so the core group is mostly employees of this company.
### Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
Docker is actually run by a company called Docker, Inc. The founder, however, is Solomon Hykes, and he has the most commits according to GitHub.
### Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
Since Docker is a pretty low level project, there really isn’t a distinction between front-end and back-end. There are core maintainers, doc maintainers, and curators. There are way more core maintainers and curators compared to doc maintainers. 
### What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
Core maintainers are responsible for all quality control related to the code. Curators are responsible for organizing and managing all issues and pull requests submitted on GitHub. 
### How is the project's participation trending and why?
The project’s participations seems to be stable. Looking at the graph on GitHub which shows contributions to master, the amount of contributions seems to be similar now to how it was in the past. Although, there has been a slight downward trend in contributions recently. 
### In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
Yes! That's because it already happened! Jessica Frazelle who has the most unique knowledge according to git by bus, left Docker but the project is still very much active. 
### In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
I think no, because the core team is mostly employees at the company. If the company failed, a lot of the main engineers would probably stop working on the project as well.
### Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
No, the project does not have any leads that focus solely on newbies. The project is supportive of new contributors but doesn’t provide really anything special for newbies.
### Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples? 
Yes the project does have documentation. It is also quite extensive and has code examples. The documentation can be found here.
### If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
I would contact people on IRC. I could also ask a question on Stackoverflow as that is monitored by core contributors to Docker.
### Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
The core maintainers are responsible for all quality related to the project. This means that they check all contributions for performance, stability, etc. They are also responsible for holding subsystem maintainers accountable. Curators make sure that all issues and pull requests are properly assigned and guide contributors to relevant materials. Curators do not review code or docs.
### Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
Yes I would enjoy this kind of structure. The reason why I enjoy this kind of structure is because it is very collaborative without hindering a contributors work. What I mean is that all the rules for contributing are all there for a reason and doesn’t hold the developer back by unnecessary discussions about a contribution.
