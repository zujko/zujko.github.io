I'll be using this first blog post to briefly talk about my blogging set up and my process for writing a blog post.

## Jekyll 
My site is created using Jekyll which is an open source static site generator. The source of which can be found [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). I've modified a theme I found, it's called [indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). 

## Writing posts
To write a post I simply write a markdown file which contains the content of my post. My site and all the markdown files are open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/zujko/zujko.github.io).
