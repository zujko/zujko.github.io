This is based off of the steps found here [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/11.2.x/1_hour_smoke_test](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/11.2.x/1_hour_smoke_test)

## Start-up
Steps 1-7 all worked out perfectly. One thing I do want to comment on is opening the XO is not very intuitive. There was no indication of how it should be opened and I felt that I took way more time than I needed to trying to figure out how to open it.

## Activities
1. I was able to open the measure activity, but I do not think that it was working properly. I tried to whistle and talk but the waves did not really change and it looked to just be random, almost as if the microphone was broken.
2. I was able to open the TamTamJam activity and was able to play audio perfectly.
3. I added sheckle has a "friend" but I couldn't find anything else that made that function really worthwhile.
4. I messed around with Calculate and was able to calculate mathematical functions and plot functions on a graph.
5. I opened Record and managed to take a few pictures!
6. Opened the Read activity and was able to view a PDF.

## Playing an .ogg file in Browse
To connected to the internet I went to the Neighborhood view and connected to RIT-Legacy. I then googled "ogg sample" and found a wikipedia link with a hosted ogg file. I was able to open it and listen to it.

## Overview
Overall the smoke test went well. I stumbled a lot in the beginning and a lot of that was due to not being familiar with both the hardware and the UI of the XO. My specific XO seems to function properly.
