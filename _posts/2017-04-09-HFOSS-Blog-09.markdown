## data.gov
As I was searching for data sets for a project, I came across data.gov. Data.gov is a site that provides machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. Awesome! Government Transparency!
I dug a little bit deeper into when this was created because I wasn't really familiar with it. It was created in 2009 after the appointment of the first Federal Chief Information Officer, Vivek Kundra. 

What is super cool about this is that one, it is open source! The code for the site is hosted [here](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/). Two, there have been tons of apps written using these datasets, a list of them can be found [here](https://www.data.gov/applications).

I think it is awesome that the federal government is embracing open data. Open data, just like open source is crucial to freedom.
