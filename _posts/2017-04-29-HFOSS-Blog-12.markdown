## GRPC
As I've mentioned before, I follow a lot of people in the Go community, so naturally I come across new and awesome open source projects regularly. Recently, there has been a lot of buzz about gRPC. I had no idea what gRPC was, so I looked into it and have a better understanding of it.

So what exactly is gRPC? Well, gRPC is an open source RPC framework developed by Google.

Google lines out their principles for developing this framework [here](http://www.grpc.io/blog/principles).

gRPC has been used internally at Google and it was open sourced in 2015. 

The source code for gRPC can be found [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)

## RPC
You might be asking what RPC is. RPC stands for Remote Procedure Calls. What this really means is that if you're using a RPC, the procedure you're calling in your code is executed in a different address space (usually a different machine on the same network).
So essentially this allows you to write procedures that are run remotely without you really having to explicitly code the details for the remote interaction.
