## Mercurial

Mercurial is a distributed source control management tool. Unlike other version control systems, Mercurial is distributed, and gives each developer a local copy of the entire development history. This means that it works independent of network access or a main server.

Mercurial was written in Python with some parts written in C. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2.

It is open source. The code can be found [here](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg-website).
