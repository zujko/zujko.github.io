## Pygame
Since we're developing our project with pygame, I figured I would dig deeper into the history of pygame and what makes up pygame.
Pygame is a free and open source library for making multimedia applications, it is built on top of the SDL library. 

As an open source project, pygame has a mailing list (pygame-users@seul.org), irc channel (freenode #pygame), and the source is available [here](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/). Pygame also follows the Python Community [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/). It's super awesome seeing pygame have so many support avenues for potential contributors. 
## SDL
Since pygame is built on top of SDL I wanted to look deeper into SDL. SDL is a cross-platform library which provides a hardware abstraction layer to computer hardware components. SDL was created by Sam Lantinga in early 1998 while working for Loki Software.

The current version of SDL uses the [zlib License](http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html). The SDL source code can be found [here](https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL).
