In this literature review, I will be taking a look at What Is Open Source and How Does It Work? by Steve Weber.

## The Gist
In this article, Steve Weber goes in depth about what open source is and how it exactly works. He answers questions such as, "Who are the people who write open source code?", "How do they collaborate with each other?" and "How do open source developers resolve disagreements?". 

## The Good
1. I thought that the quick story about the creation of linux at the beginning was a really great way to set the stage for the rest of the article. I think it really helps to paint a picture in the reader's mind that an open source project can be created by anyone and can have many collaborators from around the world.
2. When discussing the data on page 72, it was super interesting to me that many people who write open source code do it in the course of their everyday work.
3. I liked that Steve Weber talked about some misconceptions about the open source world.

## The Bad 
1. I think as a whole this article was too lengthy, I personally think it could have been shortened and still retained all the relevant information.
2. The article could have mentioned other open source projects. It seemed to just focus on the linux kernel.  
3. This isn't necessarily a "bad" but the article is a bit dated and it would be interesting to see how different the data would look today. 

## 3 Questions
1. What would the structure of a smaller open source project look like?   
2. If Linux were to be started today would the structure of the community be similar?  
3. How would this article be different if it were written about a more modern open source project?

## Review
Overall, I think this article was a very good read. I would definitely say I learned something new and I suggest anyone with an interest in open source software to give this a read.
