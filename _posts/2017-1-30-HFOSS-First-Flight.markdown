This semester I am taking Humanitarian FOSS Development. One requirement of the course is to maintain a blog and detail projects and anything else related to the course. This first post details my setup for this blog, IRC, and GitHub. 

## Blog
For this blog I am using Jekyll and hosting with GitHub pages. Blog posts are written in markdown and to deploy all I have to do is push to master!

## IRC
I use irssi as my IRC client. The reason why I chose irssi was because I do almost all my work on the command line so using a command line IRC client seemed like the right choice.

## Git/GitHub
I use Git and GitHub all the time so forking the site repo and adding a yml file with my information wasn't difficult. I do not use any gui's or tools for Git, I just do everything on the command line.
