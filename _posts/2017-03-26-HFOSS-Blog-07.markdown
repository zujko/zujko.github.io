## Snap
Snap is an open source telemetry framework. This framework makes is easy to collect, process, and publish telemetry data on a large scale.

There are multiple parts to the Snap framework. 
1. There is a daemon, ```snapteld``` and CLI, ```snaptel```
2. Plugins
3. Tasks to gather and publish metrics

## Plugin Architecture
One key feature of Snap is that it has a simple modular design. There are three types of plugins, collectors, processors, and publishers. A user can mix and match functionality as needed. 

Snap is not an analytics platform, it is to allow plugins to feed into various analytics platforms.

Snap is open source and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap).
