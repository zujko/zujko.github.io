The gist of this article was to show that 4th graders should focus on three core goals. 1) Developing an understanding with multi-digit multiplication and developing an understanding of dividing 2) Develop an understanding of fraction equivalence, addition/subtraction of fractions with like denominators, and multiplication of fractions by whole numbers 3) Understanding that geometric figures can be analyzed and classified based on their properties. 

One of the most interesting part of this article was the idea that 4th graders should understand geometric figures. I find that the most interesting is because I want to do something related to geometry for the final project.

In the article, it specifically states that for geometry, 4th grade students should...
> 1. Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in two-dimensional figures.
> 2. Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specified size. Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles. 
> 3. Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry. 

Overall, I would say that I learned a lot about the typical 4th grade curriculum and feel like I gained a better grasp of what I should accomplish for the final project.
