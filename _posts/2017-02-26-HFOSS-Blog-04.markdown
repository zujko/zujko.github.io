In this blog post I will talk about the brief history of the Go programming language.

## History
The Go programming language was developed at Google by engineers Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer. The wanted to develop a new language the solved some common issues people had with other languages while maintaining the things people liked. Their core ideas for the language included the following.

> * be statically typed, scalable to large systems 
> * be productive and readable, without too many mandatory keywords and repetition
> * not require integrated development environments, but support them well
> * support networking and multiprocessing

Go version 1.0 was released in 2012.

Go is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/golang/go)
