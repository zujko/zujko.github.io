## Project
Docker

## Project Description
Docker is an open source project which makes it easy to create, deploy, and run applications in a container. Containers are essentially like virtual machines except that instead of creating an entire virtual operating system, applications running in a container share the kernel with the host system and other containers that may be running on the system.

## Team Roles
* Peter: Lead Engineer
