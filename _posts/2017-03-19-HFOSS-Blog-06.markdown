## InfluxDB
InfluxDB is an open-source time series database. It was developed by InfluxData, written in Go, and is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data. It provides a SQL-like language with built in time-centric functions for querying data composed of measurements, series, and points. 

## Uses
InfluxDB is usually used for operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.
