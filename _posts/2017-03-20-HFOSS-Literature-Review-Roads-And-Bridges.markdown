## Title
Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure

## Author

## The Gist
Everyone uses Open Source software, from people writing personal projects, to Fortune 500 companies. All of these projects make up the digital infrastructure and just like physical infrastructure, it needs regular maintenance. This report talks about the people and support of these many open source projects.

## The Good
1. I really enjoyed the story of OpenSSL. It really put into perspective how some really popular open source projects can be just one person with very little outside support.
2. The quotes found throughout the report really stressed the main points in the report, which I enjoyed.
3. The many projects mentioned throughout this report was really great, it showed just how many Open Source projects there are and how they are critical to so many other pieces of software. 

## The Bad
1. I think it didn't need to provide explanations to some things. Such as documentation, even if you are new to software, documentation is pretty self explanatory.

## The Questions
1. What is the author's experience with Open Source?

## Review
Overall this was a great article. I was invested in the reading because of how well the information was presented. I also learned some things I didn't know before reading this, such as OpenSSL only having one developer at the time. It was also amazing to see just how many companies use Open Source software.
